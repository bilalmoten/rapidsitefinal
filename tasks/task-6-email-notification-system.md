# Email Notification and Background Processing System

This document tracks the implementation of the email notification system and background processing for quality website generation in RapidSite.

## Task Overview

Create a system to handle long-running quality website generation (5-10 minutes) and notify users when their websites are ready.

## Core Implementation Tasks

### Background Processing

- [ ] Implement job queue for website generation tasks
- [ ] Create worker process to handle generation in background
- [ ] Add status tracking and error handling

### Email Notifications

- [ ] Set up email delivery service connection
- [ ] Create website completion email template
- [ ] Implement email sending from the generation process

### Status Tracking

- [ ] Add website status fields to database
- [ ] Create API endpoint for checking generation status
- [ ] Build status indicators for the dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

- Add `status` field to websites table (enum: 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed')
- Add timestamps for tracking progress

### Key Files to Create

- `app/api/website-generation/queue.ts` - Queuing generation tasks
- `app/api/website-generation/status.ts` - Checking job status
- `emails/website-complete.tsx` - Email template
- `components/dashboard/GenerationStatus.tsx` - Status UI component

### User Flow

1. User completes website generation request
2. System queues job and shows status
3. Background process generates website
4. On completion, system sends email notification
5. User can view website in dashboard

## Potential Improvements (Secondary)

- Real-time status updates via WebSockets
- Estimated completion time calculation
- Retry mechanism for failed generation tasks
- Analytics on generation time and success rates
