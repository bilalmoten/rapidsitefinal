# Anonymous User Conversion Tasks

This document tracks the implementation of converting anonymous users to authenticated users in RapidSite.

## Task Overview

When users generate websites through the quick journey (express mode), they initially use anonymous authentication. To save, edit, or publish their websites, they need to convert to authenticated users with email/password or Google auth.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Anonymous to authenticated user conversion has been fully implemented, allowing users to save their anonymously created websites by signing up.

## Objectives

- ✅ Provide a seamless conversion from anonymous to authenticated users
- ✅ Ensure no data loss during the conversion process
- ✅ Maintain a smooth user experience throughout the authentication flow
- ✅ Support both email/password and Google authentication methods

## Implementation Tasks

### UI Components

- [x] Create a "Login to Save/Edit" banner for anonymous users in the editor
- [x] Design and implement a user conversion dialog
- [x] Add visual indicators for anonymous vs. authenticated status
- [x] Implement UI for tracking conversion progress

### Backend Implementation

- [x] Develop API endpoint for anonymous user conversion
- [x] Implement data migration from anonymous to authenticated user
- [x] Update website ownership records after conversion
- [x] Handle edge cases and potential conflicts

### Authentication Flow

- [x] Modify the login flow to handle anonymous conversion
- [x] Implement email verification if needed
- [x] Add Google OAuth integration for conversion
- [x] Create redirect logic after successful conversion

### Testing and Validation

- [x] Test email/password conversion flow
- [x] Test Google auth conversion flow
- [x] Test data integrity after conversion
- [x] Test edge cases and error handling

## Technical Details

### Implemented Files

- `app/api/auth/convert-anonymous/route.ts` - API endpoint for user conversion
- `components/editor/AnonymousUserBanner.tsx` - Banner for anonymous users
- `components/auth/ConversionDialog.tsx` - Dialog for user conversion
- `app/(app)/dashboard/editor/[website_id]/page.tsx` - Editor page with anonymous state handling
- `utils/supabase/client.ts` - Client-side Supabase utilities for auth

### Implementation Notes

The anonymous user conversion system now successfully:

1. Detects when a user is anonymous in the editor
2. Displays appropriate UI prompts for anonymous users
3. Provides a smooth conversion flow to permanent accounts
4. Migrates all website data during the authentication process
5. Redirects users back to their work after successful conversion

The implementation uses Supabase's auth linking features to maintain all user data during the conversion from anonymous to authenticated status.
