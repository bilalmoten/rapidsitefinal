# Introducing Custom Domains: Take Your Website to the Next Level

We're excited to announce the launch of custom domain support on RapidSite! This premium feature allows you to connect your own domain to your website, creating a professional and branded online presence.

## What are Custom Domains?

A custom domain is your unique web address (like www.yourcompany.com) that represents your brand online. Instead of using a subdomain on aiwebsitebuilder.tech, you can now use your own domain name, giving your website a more professional and memorable presence.

## Why Use a Custom Domain?

1. **Professional Branding**: Your own domain name builds trust and credibility with visitors
2. **Better SEO**: Custom domains can help improve your search engine rankings
3. **Brand Recognition**: A custom domain is easier to remember and share
4. **Complete Control**: Manage your online presence exactly how you want it

## Features of Our Custom Domain Support

- **Easy Setup**: Simple DNS configuration with clear instructions
- **Automatic SSL**: Free SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections
- **Quick Verification**: Fast domain verification process
- **Intuitive Management**: User-friendly interface to manage your domains

## How to Set Up Your Custom Domain

Setting up your custom domain is straightforward:

1. Purchase a domain from any domain registrar
2. Add your domain in the Website Settings page
3. Configure your DNS settings:
   - Add an A record pointing to 76.76.21.21
4. Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)
5. Your website is live on your custom domain!
