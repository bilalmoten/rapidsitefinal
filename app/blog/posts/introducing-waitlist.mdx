# Introducing Our Waitlist System: Managing Growth While Maintaining Quality

We're excited to announce a significant change in how we're handling new user registrations at RapidSite. Due to the overwhelming response and our commitment to providing the best possible experience, we're introducing a waitlist system for new users.

## Why a Waitlist?

The decision to implement a waitlist wasn't taken lightly. Since our launch, we've seen incredible interest from users wanting to build their websites with AI. While this growth is exciting, we believe in:

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Ensuring each user gets the attention and resources they need
- **Stable Performance**: Maintaining fast and reliable service for all users
- **Personalized Support**: Providing proper onboarding and support to new users

## How It Works

1. **Simple Sign-up**: Join the waitlist by providing your name and email
2. **Position Updates**: You'll receive updates about your position in the queue
3. **Batch Invitations**: We'll invite new users in batches to ensure smooth onboarding
4. **Priority Access**: When it's your turn, you'll get immediate access to all features

## What's Next?

We're continuously working on scaling our infrastructure and improving our services. The waitlist system is temporary, and we'll adjust the invitation rate based on our capacity to provide excellent service.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. We're committed to making RapidSite the best AI website builder, and this step helps us maintain that promise.

Stay tuned for more updates!
