# Growing Together: Introducing Promotional Banners for Free Websites

We're excited to announce a new feature that helps us grow our community while maintaining the professional look of your websites. Starting today, websites created with our free plan will include an elegant promotional banner that helps spread the word about RapidSite.

## Why This Change?

As we continue to grow and improve RapidSite, we want to ensure that our platform remains accessible to everyone while maintaining the resources needed to provide high-quality service. The promotional banner on free plan websites helps us:

1. **Spread the Word**: Share RapidSite with more people who could benefit from our AI-powered website builder
2. **Support Free Users**: Continue offering a generous free plan while growing our community
3. **Build Network Effects**: Create a network of websites that showcase what's possible with RapidSite

## Thoughtfully Designed

We put a lot of thought into designing the promotional banner to ensure it:

- **Looks Professional**: Features a modern gradient design that complements any website
- **Stays Unobtrusive**: Fixed at the bottom of the page, never interfering with your content
- **Loads Efficiently**: Implemented with performance in mind, not affecting your website's speed
- **Remains Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design that works well on all devices

## What's Included?

The promotional banner includes:

- A subtle mention that the site was built with RapidSite
- A link to our platform
- A clear call-to-action for visitors to create their own website

## For Our Pro Users

If you're on our Pro plan, your websites will continue to be banner-free. This is just one of the many benefits of being a Pro user, along with:

- Unlimited website generations
- More AI edits
- Priority support
- And much more!

## Looking Forward

This update is part of our ongoing effort to build a sustainable platform that can continue serving both free and pro users effectively. We're committed to maintaining a balance between accessibility and sustainability.

We're excited to see how this change helps grow our community and bring the power of AI website building to more people. As always, we welcome your feedback and suggestions on how we can make RapidSite even better.
